<h2>Purpose of the Study </h2>
<div>
<p>
The goal of this project is to develop human-machine collaboration tools to provide end-users greater autonomy in shaping their social media content.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Study Procedures</h2>
<div>
<p>
In the first part of this study, we conducted interviews with video creators on sites like YouTube and Twitch. Based on our findings from these interviews, we have created a tool to help YouTube creators and moderators manage their comments more efficiently. Now, we are looking for participantes to test this tool and help us understand its utility and deficiencies. We are looking for YouTube creators who have at least a few hundred comments posted on their channel and who are familiar with the 'Blocked Words' setting on YouTube studio. Each interview will last less than 90 minutes and participants will be compensated $25 for their time.
</p>

<p>
During the interview, we will have the participant sign in to our tool using their YouTube account. Our tool will load the comments posted to the participant's channel. Then we will walk the participant through how our tool can help them moderate their comments. As the participant explores this tool, we would ask them to speak aloud how they would use this tool, what other features they would like to have, etc.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Privacy and Security of Participants</h2>
<div>
<p>
We take the privacy and security of our participants very seriously. Our tool will NOT remove or make any changes to the participant's comments on YouTube. We will also not store their channelâ€™s comments on our site after our session has ended.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Risks, Stress or Discomfort</h2>
<div>
<p>
You may suffer emotional distress talking about the experiences of seeing offensive comments online. To avoid this, we encourage you to only relate these experiences to us if you can do so without distressing yourself.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Benefits of the Study</h2>
<div>
<p>
We will develop moderation tools based on our interviews with users like you. These tools may help you better moderate the comments you receive on your videos online.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Confidentiality of the Research Information</h2>
<div>
<p>
The interview data we collect will be kept confidential. The link between your identifiers and the research data will be destroyed after the records retention period required by state and/or federal law. All of the information you provide will be confidential. However, if we learn that you intend to harm yourself or others, we must report that to the authorities. Government or university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally. If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your privacy. The study records will not be used to put you at legal risk of harm.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Other Information</h2>
<div>
<p>
You may refuse to participate, and you are free to withdraw from this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You will receive a compensation of $25 to participate in this study.
